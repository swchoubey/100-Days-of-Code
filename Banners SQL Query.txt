PROBLEM STATEMENT:
In developing a digital marketplace for outdoor banners, a query is needed to return information about the banners in each of the cities. The result should have the following columns: city/ banners/min_area/avg_area/max_area/total_area
1. city- city name 
2. banners - total number of banners for a specific city 
3. Min_area- minimum available banner area for a specific city 
4. avg_area -average banner area for specific city, rounded up to the nearest integer, e.g ceiling(1.1) = 2 5. 
max_area- total available banner area for a specific city the result should be sorted in ascending order by city


Note:
1. banners are rectangular
